# This is my blog
### Introduction:

The Raspberry Pi is a versatile and affordable single-board computer that can be used for various projects. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of building your very own Raspberry Pi weather station. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional weather station that can measure temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. So, let's get started!

Step 1: Gather the necessary components
Before diving into the project, make sure you have all the required components. Here's a list of what you'll need:

1.Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO pins)
2.DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
3.BMP180 barometric pressure sensor
4.Breadboard and jumper wires
5.MicroSD card with Raspbian installed
6.Power supply for the Raspberry Pi
7.Computer with an SD card reader

Step 2: Set up the Raspberry Pi
First, we need to set up the Raspberry Pi. Follow these steps:

1.Insert the microSD card with Raspbian into the Raspberry Pi.
2.Connect the HDMI cable from the Raspberry Pi to a monitor or TV.
3.Plug in the keyboard and mouse to the USB ports.
4.Connect the power supply to the Raspberry Pi to turn it on.
4.Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the initial setup of Raspbian.

Step 3: Connect the sensors
Now, let's connect the sensors to the Raspberry Pi using the breadboard and jumper wires:

Place the DHT11 sensor on the breadboard and connect its VCC pin to the 3.3V pin on the Raspberry Pi.
Connect the DHT11 sensor's GND pin to any of the GND pins on the Raspberry Pi.
Connect the DHT11 sensor's DATA pin to GPIO pin 4 on the Raspberry Pi.
Next, connect the BMP180 sensor to the breadboard and connect its VCC pin to the 3.3V pin on the Raspberry Pi.
Connect the BMP180 sensor's GND pin to any of the GND pins on the Raspberry Pi.
Connect the BMP180 sensor's SDA pin to GPIO pin 2 (SDA) on the Raspberry Pi.
Connect the BMP180 sensor's SCL pin to GPIO pin 3 (SCL) on the Raspberry Pi.

Step 4: Install necessary libraries
To interact with the sensors, we need to install some libraries. Open the Terminal on the Raspberry Pi and run the following commands:

Update the package lists: sudo apt-get update
Install the required libraries: sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip
Install the Adafruit DHT library: sudo pip3 install Adafruit_DHT
Install the BMP library: sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-bmp
Step 5: Write the code
Create a new Python script on the Raspberry Pi using your preferred text editor. Copy and paste the following code into the script:


```py
import Adafruit_DHT
import board
import busio
import adafruit_bmp180

dht_pin = 4
bmp_sda_pin = board.SDA
bmp_scl_pin = board.SCL

def get_temperature_humidity():
    humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(Adafruit_DHT.DHT11, dht_pin)
    return temperature, humidity

def get_pressure():
    i2c = busio.I2C(bmp_scl_pin, bmp_sda_pin)
    bmp180 = adafruit_bmp180.Adafruit_BMP180_I2C(i2c)
    return bmp180.pressure

while True:
    temperature, humidity = get_temperature_humidity()
    pressure = get_pressure()
    print(f"Temperature: {temperature}Â°C")
    print(f"Humidity: {humidity}%")
    print(f"Pressure: {pressure} Pa")

```
